# GIS Microcredential Capstone Projects
This folder contains four projects I conducted on the Ayobo - Olorunda road, a 5.1km long and 20m wide road that
runs from Megida, (Lat. 6.6006◦, Long. 3.2417◦) through Ishefun, Olorunda (Lat. 6.5752◦, Long. 3.2045◦), Lagos, Nigeria. 

These projects are part of my micro-credential in Geospatial Data Collection, Analysis & Interpretation using GIS Technology (GIS) 
at Seneca Polytechnic, Canada. They include:
- [Traffic Analysis and Safety](https://github.com/GEO-001/Hands-on-Projects/blob/main/Project%20files/Seneca%20Polytechnic%20Capstone%20Projects/Traffic%20analysis%20%26%20Safety.pdf): Analyzing traffic patterns to improve road safety and optimize traffic flow.
- [Military Checkpoint Establishment](https://github.com/GEO-001/Hands-on-Projects/blob/main/Project%20files/Seneca%20Polytechnic%20Capstone%20Projects/Military%20Checkpoint%20Establishment.pdf): Developing GIS solutions for the strategic placement of military checkpoints.
- [Field Maps App for Spatial Data Collection](https://github.com/GEO-001/Hands-on-Projects/blob/main/Project%20files/Seneca%20Polytechnic%20Capstone%20Projects/ArcGIS%20Field%20Maps%20for%20Spatial%20Data%20Collection.pdf): Utilizing the ESRI Field Maps app to gather and manage spatial data efficiently.
- [200m Boundary Delineation](https://github.com/GEO-001/Hands-on-Projects/blob/main/Project%20files/Seneca%20Polytechnic%20Capstone%20Projects/Buffer%20analysis-boundary_delineation.pdf): Defining a 200-meter jurisdiction for real estate purposes.
