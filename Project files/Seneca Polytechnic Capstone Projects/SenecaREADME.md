# GIS Microcredential Capstone Projects
This folder contains four projects I conducted on the Ayobo - Olorunda road, a 5.1km long and 20m wide road that
runs from Megida, (Lat. 6.6006◦, Long. 3.2417◦) through Ishefun, Olorunda (Lat. 6.5752◦, Long. 3.2045◦), Lagos, Nigeria. 

These projects are part of my micro-credential in Geospatial Data Collection, Analysis & Interpretation using GIS Technology (GIS) 
at Seneca Polytechnic, Canada. They include:
- Traffic Analysis and Safety: Analyzing traffic patterns to improve road safety and optimize traffic flow.
- Military Checkpoint Establishment: Developing GIS solutions for the strategic placement of military checkpoints.
- ESRI Field Maps App for Spatial Data Collection: Utilizing the ESRI Field Maps app to gather and manage spatial data efficiently.
- Buffer Analysis Tool for Boundary Delineation: Creating a tool to define a 200-meter boundary around properties for real estate purposes.
