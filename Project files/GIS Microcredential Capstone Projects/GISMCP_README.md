# GIS Microcredential Capstone Projects
This folder contains four projects I conducted on the Ayobo - Olorunda road, a 5.1km long and 20m wide road that
runs from Megida, (Lon. 3.2417◦, Lat. 6.6006◦) through Ishefun, Olorunda, (Long. 3.2045◦, Lat. 6.5752◦) Lagos, Nigeria. 

These projects are part of my microcredential in Geospatial Data Collection, Analysis & Interpretation using GIS Technology (GIS) 
at Seneca Polytechnic, Canada. They include:
- [Traffic Analysis and Safety](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-LFS324v1APkLt7mgybzn6i0YaM3ZvI9/view?usp=drive_link): Analyzing traffic patterns to improve road safety and optimize traffic flow.
- [Military Checkpoint Establishment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RTem5bdt5AWOhkDCwZXbOuGIlpn6BWOd/view?usp=drive_link): Developing GIS solutions for the strategic placement of military checkpoints.
- [Field Maps App for Spatial Data Collection](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZHNpqS4IoPLO0mEBtyCZPubhGNZ9jCwR/view?usp=drive_link): Utilizing the ESRI Field Maps app to gather and manage spatial data efficiently.
